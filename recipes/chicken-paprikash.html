    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Chicken paprikash, also known as "csirkepaprikás" in Hungarian, is a
      classic and comforting Hungarian dish that has gained popularity
      worldwide. This flavorful and hearty dish is made with tender pieces of
      chicken, typically bone-in and skin-on, which are simmered in a rich and
      creamy paprika-infused sauce. The star ingredient in chicken paprikash is
      the Hungarian paprika, which adds a vibrant red color and a distinct
      smoky, sweet, and slightly spicy flavor to the dish. The paprika is
      sautéed with onions and garlic, creating a fragrant base for the sauce.
      Sour cream is then added to the mixture, giving the sauce its creamy
      texture and a delightful tangy note. This delicious concoction is served
      over a bed of egg noodles or dumplings, making it a comforting and
      satisfying meal that's perfect for warming up on a chilly evening.

      sour cream for added creaminess. It's not only a gastronomic delight but
      also a cultural icon that reflects the rich culinary traditions of
      Hungary. Whether enjoyed in a cozy home kitchen or a traditional Hungarian
      restaurant, chicken paprikash is a dish that captures the essence of

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p>
          Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rapid boil.
          Cook egg noodles at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, 7 to 9
          minutes. Drain and toss with butter, parsley, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and
          1/2 teaspoon pepper. Keep noodles warm while preparing the chicken.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p>
          Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®) and
          select Saute function. Add oil, shallots, and garlic; saute until
          fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour in pasta sauce, chicken broth, and red
          wine vinegar.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <p>
          Season chicken with remaining 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.
          Add chicken to the pot. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure
          according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 12 minutes.
          Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Step 4</h3>
        <p>
          Release pressure using the natural-release method according to
          manufacturer's instructions, about 10 minutes. Release remaining
          pressure carefully using the quick-release method.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Step 5</h3>
        <p>
          Place 1/2 cup yogurt in a small bowl. Add in 1/2 cup of sauce, a
          tablespoon at time, to temper the yogurt. Add paprika and blend well.
          Pour yogurt mixture back into the pot. Shred the chicken thighs and
          serve over cooked noodles. Garnish each serving with a dollop of
          yogurt.
