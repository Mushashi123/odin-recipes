    <h2 class="h-secondary">Description</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Bibimbap</strong> is a delicious and colorful Korean dish that has
      gained international popularity for its harmonious blend of flavors and
      textures. The name <em>"bibimbap"</em> translates to
      <em>"mixed rice"</em> in English, which perfectly describes the essence of
      this dish. At its core, bibimbap consists of a bed of steamed rice topped
      with a vibrant array of sautéed and seasoned vegetables, often including
      ingredients like <em>spinach</em>, <em> bean sprouts </em>,
      <em>carrots</em>, and <em>mushrooms</em>. What sets bibimbap apart is the
      addition of a protein source, which can range from thinly sliced marinated
      beef (known as <em>bulgogi</em>) to <em>tofu</em> or even a fried egg. To
      bring it all together, a spicy and savory <strong>gochujang sauce</strong>
      is typically drizzled over the top, adding a punch of flavor that ties the
      elements of the dish together. The final touch is a sprinkling of sesame
      seeds and sometimes crispy, toasted seaweed, creating a visually stunning
      and incredibly satisfying meal.
    </p>

      Bibimbap is not only celebrated for its delightful taste but also its
      presentation. Served in a hot stone bowl called a "<em>dolsot</em>," the
      rice on the bottom becomes beautifully crisp as it comes into contact with
      the heated surface. This contrast in textures, from the
      <em>crunchy rice</em> to the tender vegetables and flavorful meat or tofu,
      adds to the overall appeal of the dish. The customizable nature of
      bibimbap makes it a favorite among food enthusiasts, as diners can tailor
      the ingredients to suit their preferences. Whether enjoyed at a Korean
      restaurant or prepared at home, bibimbap is a flavorful, nutritious, and
      visually striking dish that embodies the essence of Korean cuisine.

    <h2 class="h-secondary">Steps</h2>
    <ol class="steps">
      <li>
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p>
          Stir together cucumber pieces and gochujang paste in a bowl; set
          aside.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p>
          Bring about 2 cups water to a boil in a large nonstick skillet and
          stir in spinach; cook until bright green and wilted, 2 to 3 minutes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <p>
          Drain spinach and squeeze out as much moisture as possible; set
          spinach aside in a bowl and stir in soy sauce.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Step 4</h3>
        <p>
          Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in a large nonstick skillet; cook and stir
          carrots until softened, about 3 minutes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Step 5</h3>
        <p>
          Stir in garlic and cook just until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in
          cucumber mixture; sprinkle with red pepper flakes. Set carrot mixture
          aside in a bowl.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Step 6</h3>
        <p>
          Brown beef in a clean nonstick skillet over medium heat, about 5
          minutes per side; set aside.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Step 7</h3>
        <p>
          Heat remaining 1 teaspoon olive oil in another nonstick skillet over
          medium-low heat. Fry eggs just on one side until yolks are runny, but
          whites are firm, 2 to 4 minutes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Step 8</h3>
        <p>
          Divide cooked rice into 4 large serving bowls; top with spinach
          mixture, a few pieces of beef, and cucumber mixture. Place 1 egg atop
          each serving. Drizzle each bowl with 1 teaspoon sesame oil, a sprinkle
          of sesame seeds, and a small amount of gochujang paste if desired.
